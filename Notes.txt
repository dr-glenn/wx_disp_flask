I'm having troubles with "content security policy".
I can't use maps.googleapis.com in radar.html with any modern browser because they all
complain about Content Security Policy violations. In Edge I was able to get around it by
loosening the tracking inhibitions. Possibly I need to put a CSP in my HTML header:

And now I can't access https://radar.weather.gov/ridge/RadarImg/N0R/MUX/, which is where I fetch
radar GIFs. But this has nothing to do with my web pages, so setting a CSP header will not work.
